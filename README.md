# Getting and Cleaning Data Course project

Repo submission for the Johns Hopkins - Getting and Cleaning Data course project

# Introduction

This project is to demonstrate the ability to collect, work with, and clean a data set. The goal is to prepare tidy data that can be used for later analysis.

A full description is available at the site where the data was obtained:

Here are the data for the project:

# Modifications to This Script (run_analysis.R)

Please note that below note in the script:

1. line 2 - Please set your directory path to the create for the dataset to be downloaded.

2. line 5 - Please set your own file name in the set directory path 

3. line 18 - Please set your working directory where the unzipped dataset resides  

# Project description

You should create one R script called run_analysis.R that does the following: 

1. Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set. 

2. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement. 

3. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set 

4. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive activity names. 

5. Creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

# Additional Information

Additional information about the variables, data and transformations can be found in the CodeBook.MD file.
